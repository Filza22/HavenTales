Full Story Summary:
At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends — especially Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger — and learns about his past. He discovers that his parents were killed by a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort, whose killing curse mysteriously failed when he tried to kill baby Harry. This event made Harry famous in the wizarding world  as “The Boy Who Lived.”
Throughout the school year, Harry and his friends uncover the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone, a magical object that grants immortality. They suspect their teacher Professor Snape is trying to steal it for Voldemort.
However, it turns out Professor Quirrell is the real villain, possessed by Voldemort himself. In a dramatic climax, Harry protects the Stone, and Voldemort is once again defeated — though not destroyed.
Harry returns to his relatives for the summer, having found friendship, courage, and a sense of belonging.
Harry Potter, an orphaned boy living with his cruel aunt, uncle, and cousin, learns on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard. He receives a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, inviting him to study magic.

Moral:
- Love is the strongest magic.
- True courage and friendship overcome evil.
- It's our choices that show who we really are, far more than our abilities.
