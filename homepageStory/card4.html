            <p>
                The story begins in India with <strong> Mary Lennox,</strong> a sickly and sour-tempered ten-year-old
                girl. She is a
                neglected child of wealthy British parents who are too self-absorbed to care for her. When her parents
                and most of the household staff die in a cholera outbreak, Mary is sent to live with her reclusive and
                hunchbacked uncle,<strong> Archibald Craven,</strong> at his isolated estate, Misselthwaite Manor, on
                the Yorkshire moors
                in England.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, Mary is as disagreeable as ever, disliking her new home and its inhabitants. She spends her
                time wandering the vast grounds and becomes curious about a walled garden that has been locked for ten
                years. She learns that the garden belonged to her uncle's deceased wife, who died after a tragic
                accident there. In his grief, Mr. Craven locked the garden and buried the key.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the help of a friendly robin, Mary discovers the key and a hidden door to the garden. She finds it
                overgrown and neglected but with signs of life. She begins to secretly tend to the garden, and her
                health and spirits improve as she works in the fresh air. She befriends Dickon, a local boy with a deep
                connection to nature and animals, who helps her bring the garden back to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                One night, Mary hears the sound of a child crying and discovers her cousin,<strong> Colin
                    Craven,</strong> who has been
                confined to his room and bed for years. Colin is also sickly and temperamental, convinced that he is an
                invalid and will die young like his mother. He has been largely forgotten by his father, who cannot bear
                the sight of his son because he reminds him of his lost wife.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mary shares her secret of the garden with Colin and Dickon. The three children begin to meet in the
                garden, and the fresh air, sunshine, and companionship work wonders. Colin's health and spirits improve
                dramatically. He learns to stand and walk, keeping his recovery a secret from the household staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, <strong>Archibald Craven,</strong> who has been traveling to escape his painful memories, has
                a dream that
                prompts him to return home. He is shocked and overjoyed to find the secret garden in full bloom and his
                son, Colin, healthy and running around. The family is reunited, and Misselthwaite Manor, once a gloomy
                and sad place, is filled with new life and hope.

She spends her time wandering the vast grounds and becomes curious about a walled garden that has been locked for ten years. She learns that the garden belonged to her uncle's deceased wife, who died after a tragic accident there. In his grief, Mr. Craven locked the garden and buried the key.

With the help of a friendly robin, Mary discovers the key and a hidden door to the garden. She finds it overgrown and neglected but with signs of life. She begins to secretly tend to the garden, and her health and spirits improve as she works in the fresh air. She befriends Dickon, a local boy with a deep connection to nature and animals, who helps her bring the garden back to life.

One night, Mary hears the sound of a child crying and discovers her cousin, Colin Craven, who has been confined to his room and bed for years. Colin is also sickly and temperamental, convinced that he is an invalid and will die young like his mother. He has been largely forgotten by his father, who cannot bear the sight of his son because he reminds him of his lost wife.

Mary shares her secret of the garden with Colin and Dickon. The three children begin to meet in the garden, and the fresh air, sunshine, and companionship work wonders. Colin's health and spirits improve dramatically. He learns to stand and walk, keeping his recovery a secret from the household staff.

Meanwhile, Archibald Craven, who has been traveling to escape his painful memories, has a dream that prompts him to return home. He is shocked and overjoyed to find the secret garden in full bloom and his son, Colin, healthy and running around. The family is reunited, and Misselthwaite Manor, once a gloomy and sad place, is filled with new life and hope.

Moral:
- The power of a positive mindset and the healing influence of nature can transform lives.
